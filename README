liboil
======

A C library for resizing images. It currently does all resizing with a
catmull-rom interpolator. This library aims for fast performance, low memory
use, and accuracy.

Requirements
------------

libjpeg development headers and libpng development headers are required for the
oil executable.

Building
--------

Running make will generate the oil executable:

    $ make

Testing
-------

Oil includes a test binary that compares the output of the resizer to a
reference implementation. You can build it with:

    $ make test

And run it with:

    $ ./test

Some tests currently fail against the reference implementation. Although these
failures are probably imperceptable, they are currently being left in place so
that they can be evaluated.
